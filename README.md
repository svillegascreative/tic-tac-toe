# Happy Hour (Tic Tac Toe)

## Phase One (Feb 2017)
During the JavaScript portion of a Web Development Immersive course at Bitmaker (GA Toronto), one of our assignments was to build a game of Tic Tac Toe. It seemed pretty straightforward, so I had a little fun with the interface, giving it a "happy hour" theme.

## Phase Two (Jul 2017)
The game was playable and fun when I completed the assignment, but having gotten carried away with the interface, I neglected to build in the logic that actually detected and announced the end of the game (win or draw). This nagged at me, so I went back, refactored a bunch of code, and built the end of the game. 

## Play it!
I actually built this mostly on CodePen (hence the lack of commits), but that means you can [actually play the game](https://codepen.io/svillegas/full/KaYKWE)&ast;!

*&ast; Please play responsibly, and never drive after playing.*
